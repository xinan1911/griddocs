3. Next, request new certificate and select a product:

   * GEANT Personal Authentication - **your preferred certificate**: for authentication and accessing Research and e-Infrastructures like the GRID

   * GEANT Personal Automated Authentication - credentials for automated processes and software agents that are running under your personal control
     
   * For email signing certificates, use the "Email" menu and select either a simple mailbox-validated one (without a name)

5. Find the "Ready Certificates" on "My Dashboard", and click on "Enroll your Certificate". For the Enrollment Method, choose "Key Generation" and select the Key type RSA - 2048 or RSA - 4096. Do not choose any other option here (they are for experts only).

6. Think of a strong passphrase (at least 15 characters), memorize it, or keep it in a secure password manager, then enter it in the dialog boxes (twice).

7. Download the certificate in a safe place and make a backup copy of the file. The filename is **Certificate.p12**.

8. Now you can import your certificate in your browser or convert it into a series of files you can use for grid, personal, and browser usage. 


.. _use_harica:


===============================
Use a *Harica* certificate
===============================

You can use the Harica certificate in two forms:

* the ".p12" file can used in browsers and/or email client,

* convert to "PEM" file for for authentication and accessing Research and e-Infrastructures like the DNI, GinA, WLCG, EGI, &c ('grid').


Import certificate in browser
===============================


For Firefox users,

1. Open the Options screen and the "Privacy & Security" section (type "about:preferences#privacy" in the address bar)

2. Scroll down to find "View Certificates..."

3. Click on "View Certificates..."

4. In the dialog box, click on "Import..."

5. Select the file (.p12 or .pfx) using the file selection box and click "Open". Enter the password that was used to encrypt this certificate backup and click OK.



For Safari users opening a p12 file will open it in Keychain, please follow the `Apple Import guide from DigiCert`_.


For other browser users, please check `Generation 5 GEANT Trusted Certificate Service TCS`_.


Convert .p12 file and use on GRID UI
=====================================

The following commands will download the "tcsg4-install-credential.sh" script, and convert the downloaded PKCS#12 (.p12) file into a series of files you can use for grid, personal, and browser usage. During this process, you need to enter the password you used during certificate creation.

* Download the script

   .. code-block:: console

        curl -o tcsg4-install-credential.sh https://ca.dutchgrid.nl/tcsg4/tcsg4-install-credential.sh

* Convert the file

   .. code-block:: console                                                                                                                                                                                                                              sh ./tcsg4-install-credential.sh -R Certificate.p12

Upon successful completion, you will see several new files generated.


* On GIRD UI, you can test by creating VOMS proxy

  .. code-block:: console                                                                                                                                                                                                                              voms-proxy-init -voms <put VO name here>
